# Module 2 – The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Focus  
**Physics simulation and environment building**

This module focuses on building realistic digital twins of humanoid robots using Gazebo and Unity. You will learn how physical laws, sensors, and environments are accurately simulated.

## Chapters in This Module

- Simulating Physics, Gravity, and Collisions in Gazebo  
- High-Fidelity Rendering and Human-Robot Interaction in Unity  
- Simulating Sensors: LiDAR, Depth Cameras, and IMUs  

After this module, you will be able to construct realistic training environments for humanoid robots.
