# URDF for Humanoid Robot Modeling Sources

## Credible Sources for URDF and Humanoid Robot Modeling in ROS 2

1.  **ROS 2 Documentation - URDF**: The official documentation provides an overview of URDF and how it integrates with ROS 2.
    *   [http://wiki.ros.org/urdf](http://wiki.ros.org/urdf) (still relevant, often linked from ROS 2 docs for core URDF concepts)
    *   [https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Intermediate/URDF/Building-a-Visual-Robot-Model-with-URDF-from-Scratch.html](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Intermediate/URDF/Building-a-Visual-Robot-Model-with-URDF-from-Scratch.html) (ROS 2 specific tutorial)

2.  **`urdf` Package in ROS 2**: The source code and examples within the `urdf` package and related packages (e.g., `urdf_parser_py`) on GitHub.
    *   [https://github.com/ros/urdf](https://github.com/ros/urdf)

3.  **The Construct (Robotics Academy) - URDF Tutorials**: Practical tutorials, often demonstrating URDF creation and visualization in Gazebo and RViz.
    *   [https://www.theconstructsim.com/category/urdf/](https://www.theconstructsim.com/category/urdf/)

4.  **Books on ROS/ROS 2 Robotics**: Books covering robot modeling often dedicate chapters to URDF.
    *   "ROS Robotics Projects" by Ramaiah Kumar, Lentin Joseph (Packt Publishing) - often contains URDF examples for various robots.

5.  **Gazebo Documentation - URDF Integration**: How URDF models are used within the Gazebo simulation environment.
    *   [https://gazebosim.org/docs/harmonic/ros2_integration](https://gazebosim.org/docs/harmonic/ros2_integration)
    *   [https://gazebosim.org/docs/fortress/sdf_elements](https://gazebosim.org/docs/fortress/sdf_elements) (for understanding relation/differences with SDF)

These sources will be used to explain URDF structure, links, joints, and building humanoid components for Chapter 4 of Module 1.
