# ROS 2 `rclpy` Python Client Library Sources

## Credible Sources for `rclpy` and Python Control in ROS 2

1.  **ROS 2 Documentation - `rclpy`**: The official documentation provides specific tutorials and API references for `rclpy`.
    *   [https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Programming-CPP-and-Python-for-ROS2.html](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Programming-CPP-and-Python-for-ROS2.html)
    *   [https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Writing-A-Simple-Python-Publisher-And-Subscriber.html](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Writing-A-Simple-Python-Publisher-And-Subscriber.html)
    *   [https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Writing-A-Simple-Python-Service-And-Client.html](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Writing-A-Simple-Python-Service-And-Client.html)

2.  **ROS 2 `rclpy` API Reference**: Detailed API documentation for the `rclpy` library.
    *   [https://docs.ros2.org/latest/api/rclpy/](https://docs.ros2.org/latest/api/rclpy/)

3.  **The Construct (Robotics Academy) - `rclpy` tutorials**: Practical, hands-on tutorials for using `rclpy` in various robotics scenarios.
    *   [https://www.theconstructsim.com/tag/rclpy/](https://www.theconstructsim.com/tag/rclpy/)
    *   Their courses often include comprehensive examples of `rclpy` for robot control.

4.  **Community Forums and GitHub Repositories**: Exploring well-maintained ROS 2 projects on GitHub can provide valuable insights into `rclpy` best practices and real-world control examples.
    *   [ROS Discourse](https://discourse.ros.org/)
    *   GitHub search for `rclpy` examples within ROS 2 packages.

These sources will be used to develop practical `rclpy` examples and explanations for Chapter 3 of Module 1.
