# ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services Sources

## Credible Sources for ROS 2 Communication Patterns

1.  **ROS 2 Documentation - Concepts**: The official ROS 2 documentation's "Concepts" section provides fundamental explanations of nodes, topics, services, and actions.
    *   [https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Concepts.html](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Concepts.html)
    *   Specific pages:
        *   [Nodes](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Concepts/About-Nodes.html)
        *   [Topics](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Concepts/About-Topics.html)
        *   [Services](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Concepts/About-Services.html)
        *   [Actions](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Concepts/About-Actions.html)

2.  **ROS 2 Tutorials**: The official tutorials offer hands-on guides for implementing nodes, topics, and services in both Python and C++.
    *   [https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials.html](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials.html)
    *   Specific tutorials:
        *   [Writing a Simple Publisher and Subscriber (Python)](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Writing-A-Simple-Cpp-Publisher-And-Subscriber.html)
        *   [Writing a Simple Service and Client (Python)](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Writing-A-Simple-Cpp-Service-And-Client.html)

3.  **The Construct (Robotics Academy) - ROS 2 Basics**: Their ROS 2 Basics course extensively covers these communication patterns with practical examples in simulations.
    *   [https://www.theconstructsim.com/ros2-courses/](https://www.theconstructsim.com/ros2-courses/)

4.  **ROS 2 Foxy/Galactic/Humble Books**: Books focusing on these ROS 2 distributions often dedicate chapters to explaining these core concepts in detail.
    *   "ROS 2 in 7 Days" by Dr. S.M. Monzurul Islam
    *   "Hands-On ROS 2" by Patrick Goebel and Lentin Joseph

These sources will provide the foundation for explaining ROS 2 communication patterns in Chapter 2 of Module 1.
