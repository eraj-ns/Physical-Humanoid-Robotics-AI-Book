# Data Model: Module 3 Concepts

This document outlines the key conceptual entities covered in Module 3. As a content module, the "data model" represents the core topics and their relationships, not a physical data schema.

## Entity: AI-Robot Brain

-   **Description**: A conceptual architecture for a humanoid robot's control system. It serves as the central theme connecting all other entities in this module.
-   **Attributes**:
    -   Integrates perception, planning, and action components.
    -   Leverages NVIDIA Isaac technologies.
-   **Relationships**:
    -   **Contains**: Isaac Sim (for training/testing), Isaac ROS (for perception), Nav2 (for planning).

## Entity: Isaac Sim

-   **Description**: A robotics simulation platform used to create photorealistic, physically-accurate virtual environments for training and testing the AI-Robot Brain.
-   **Attributes**:
    -   Photorealistic rendering.
    -   Physics simulation.
    -   Synthetic data generation capabilities.
-   **Relationships**:
    -   **Used by**: AI-Robot Brain.
    -   **Produces**: Synthetic Data.

## Entity: Isaac ROS

-   **Description**: A collection of hardware-accelerated ROS 2 packages that provide perception capabilities to the AI-Robot Brain.
-   **Attributes**:
    -   Optimized for NVIDIA hardware (GPUs).
    -   Includes algorithms like VSLAM.
-   **Relationships**:
    -   **Part of**: AI-Robot Brain's perception system.
    -   **Implements**: VSLAM.

## Entity: Nav2

-   **Description**: The standard navigation stack in ROS 2, used by the AI-Robot Brain for path planning and obstacle avoidance.
-   **Attributes**:
    -   Path planning algorithms.
    -   Special considerations for bipedal locomotion.
-   **Relationships**:
    -   **Part of**: AI-Robot Brain's planning and action system.

## Entity: Synthetic Data

-   **Description**: Artificially generated data from simulation used for training and testing perception models without requiring real-world data.
-   **Attributes**:
    -   Image data (RGB, depth, segmentation).
    -   Ground truth labels.
-   **Relationships**:
    -   **Generated by**: Isaac Sim.
    -   **Consumed by**: AI models for training (outside the immediate scope of this module, but an important concept).

## Entity: VSLAM (Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)

-   **Description**: A specific algorithm, implemented within Isaac ROS, that allows the robot to build a map of its environment and track its own position within that map using camera data.
-   **Attributes**:
    -   Input: Camera data (mono or stereo).
    -   Output: A map of the environment and the robot's estimated pose.
-   **Relationships**:
    -   **A feature of**: Isaac ROS.
