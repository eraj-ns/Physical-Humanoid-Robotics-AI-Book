# Module 1 – The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Focus  
**Middleware for robot control**

This module introduces ROS 2 as the central nervous system of a humanoid robot. You will learn how software components communicate, how control signals flow, and how virtual robots are described and managed.

## Chapters in This Module

- ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services  
- Bridging Python Agents to ROS Controllers using `rclpy`  
- Understanding URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) for Humanoids  

By the end of this module, you will be able to design, control, and simulate a basic humanoid robot using ROS 2.
