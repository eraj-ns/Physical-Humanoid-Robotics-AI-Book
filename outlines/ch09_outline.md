# Chapter 9 Outline: Edge Deployment to Jetson

## Learning Objectives
- Prepare the Jetson Orin for ROS 2 development.
- Cross-compile a ROS 2 workspace for ARM64.
- Deploy and run a ROS 2 node on the Jetson.
- Understand the challenges of edge deployment.

## Sections
1.  **Setting up the Jetson**: Flashing the OS and installing dependencies
2.  **Cross-Compilation**: Building for a different architecture
3.  **Deploying the Code**: `scp` or `rsync`
4.  **Running the Node**: Executing the code on the Jetson
5.  **Edge Considerations**: Performance, Power, and Heat

## Labs
- **Lab 9.1**: Cross-compiling the talker/listener example and running it on the Jetson.
