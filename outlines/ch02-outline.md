# Chapter 2 Outline: Digital Twin Environment Design

## 1. Learning Objectives

- Define the concept of a Digital Twin.
- Create a simple robot model using URDF.
- Build a Gazebo world with static objects.
- Spawn a robot model into a Gazebo world using a ROS 2 launch file.

## 2. Introduction

- What is a Digital Twin and why is it useful?
- Overview of the chapter's content.

## 3. Creating a Robot Model with URDF

- The `<robot>` tag and its elements.
- Defining links (`<link>`).
- Defining joints (`<joint>`).
- Adding visual and collision elements.
- Example: a simple two-wheeled robot.

## 4. Building a Gazebo World

- The `.world` file format.
- Adding static models from Gazebo's model database.
- Creating custom static models.
- Setting up lighting and other environmental properties.

## 5. Spawning the Robot

- Using the `spawn_entity.py` script.
- Creating a ROS 2 launch file to start Gazebo and spawn the robot.
- Verifying that the robot is spawned correctly.

## 6. Conclusion

- Summary of key takeaways.
- What's next: Visualizing the digital twin in Unity.
