# Chapter 10 Outline: Mini Capstone Project

## Learning Objectives
- Integrate all the concepts from the previous chapters.
- Create a complete ROS 2 application from scratch.

## Sections
1.  **Project Overview**: The Goal and the Architecture
2.  **The Humanoid Robot**: Creating the URDF model
3.  **The Teleop Node**: Translating keyboard commands to `geometry_msgs/Twist`
4.  **The Robot Controller**: Subscribing to `Twist` messages and moving the robot
5.  **Putting it all together**: Using a launch file to start the system
